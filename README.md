## About

A website dedicated to my other project: [Glitched Writer](https://github.com/thetarnav/glitched-writer) - an npm javascript module, for writing text with customizable effects.

## Technology used

-  ### Vue 3
   -  with the heavy use of **Composition** & **Reactive Api**, to build global source-of-truth in the form of couple file-seperated modules. Instead of using vuex, because it lack full typescript support.
-  ### Typescript
-  ### TailwindCSS
   -  SCSS was also used here and there, where tailwind couldn't be
-  [glitched-writer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glitched-writer) & [vue-glitched-writer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-glitched-writer)

## Design

I used Figma for both UX and UI Design. The visual style itself is mostly inspired by NieR: Automata UI and generally the rough style of data-heavy control panels. The goal was to create an interesting and fitting design with very limited pallete of colors: 5 shades of brownish gray.
